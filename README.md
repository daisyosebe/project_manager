# 05 Third-Party APIs: Task Board


# Project Manager
## Description
```
When the task board is opened, 

you're presented with columns labeled to do, in progress, and done. 

When you click 'add task' you're able to enter a title, due date, and description of the task. 

The task is then saved to local storage and rendered in the To-Do column.

The task cards are also color-coded yellow for nearing the due date or red for overdue.  

You are able to drag the task cards between to-do, in progress, and done. 

When the delete button is clicked for the task, 

the task is removed from the page.
